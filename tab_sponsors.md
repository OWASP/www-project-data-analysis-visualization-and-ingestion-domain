## Call for DAVID Sponsors

The Data Analysis, Visualization, and Ingestion Domain (DAVID) Project 
is the open source software data management project for OWASP and open source 
projects.

We are seeking sponsors to support the DAVID project. All proceeds from the
sponsorship support the mission of the OWASP Foundation, further
development of DAVID, and operating costs. Supporting the project drives the 
funding for research grants, hosting, tools, templates, documents, promotion,
and more.

By sponsoring DAVID, you not only support an important project, you will also 
get visibility during the next SAMM User Conference 
and recognition on the OWASP SAMM [web site](https://owaspsamm.org/) and
the next releases of SAMM.

For more information: Contact <brian.glas@owasp.org> or <daniel.ting@owasp.org>
